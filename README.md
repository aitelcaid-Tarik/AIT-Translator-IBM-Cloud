# AIT Translator

## About
The aim of this project is to develop an Android application that uses IBMâ€™s Watson Language Translator service to translate text from a source to a target language.<br>
Translation is available among Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, German, and Spanish.
The application uses the Material design system for the user interface design.<br>
We test our application using JUnit, Mockito and Espresso at three different levels:<br>
Markup : * Local Unit Tests
		 * Instrumented Tests
		 * UI Tests
